Hello, I am Abdel Rahman Ahmed from Egypt. I am a vulnerability discoverer and at the same time a developer of penetration testing tools for websites and networks. I have obtained many certificates, including a certificate from the Institute of Information Technology, because I discovered many vulnerabilities in many websites and large sites, such as a vulnerability in Google and a vulnerability in Microsoft, which leads I obtained the title of Snake of the Year from Google and some certificates in various fields in Python programming , هذا بفضل ربي (thanks to God)
